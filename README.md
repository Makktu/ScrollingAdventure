# Scrolling Adventure

A traditional turn-based RPG that utilises touchscreen and scrolling to move around a world.

The object is to find the Object. It is hidden somewhere in the world. Travel the world to find clues. Find the Object. Nothing else matters.

Battle enemies and recruit allies.

Currently working on the most basic aspect: the swipe-and-scroll mechanic that will move the game and player in the world.

Might be a sci-fi world, might be fantasy, will probably have elements of both.
